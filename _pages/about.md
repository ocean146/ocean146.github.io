[SimROD: A Simple Baseline for Raw Object Detection with Global and Local Enhancements](https://ocean146.github.io/SimROD2025/)

<strong>Haiyang Xie</strong>, <a href="https://xishen0220.github.io" target="_blank">Xi Shen</a>, <a href="http://www.shihuahuang.cn" target="_blank">Shihua Huang</a>, <a href="https://qiruiwang0728.github.io/homepage/" target="_blank">Qirui Wang</a>, <a href="https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Zheng Wang</a>

- SimROD takes a packed RAW image as input and first learns a global gamma transformation through the Global Gamma Enhancement (GGE) module. The transformed data is then processed by Green-Guided Local Enhancement (GGLE) to enhance local details. SimROD outperformed the state-of-the-art method with just 1% of the parameters. Code and paper are available at <a href="https://ocean146.github.io/SimROD2025/">Project Page</a>.

[Striking a balance: Unsupervised cross-domain crowd counting via knowledge diffusion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581783.3611797)

<strong>Haiyang Xie*</strong>, Zhengwei Yang\*, Huilin Zhu, Zheng Wang†

- This paper introduces a Selfawareness Knowledge Diffusion method (SaKnD) that leverages the self-knowledge without establishing cross-domain knowledge relationships, which aims to balance the knowledge bias between general and domain-specific knowledge
